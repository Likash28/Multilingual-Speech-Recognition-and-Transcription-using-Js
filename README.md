# 🎤 Speech-to-Text Web Application 📝

## 📄 Overview
This repository contains a simple yet powerful **Speech-to-Text Web Application** that allows users to convert their spoken words into text in real-time. The application supports multiple languages 🌍 and provides options to download the converted text 🖨️ and clear the results 🗑️.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the speech recognition functionality and user interactions.
- **Web Speech API**: Utilized for the speech-to-text conversion.

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🤖 How It Works
The application leverages the **Web Speech API** to perform speech recognition:
- **Initialization**: When the user clicks the "Start Listening" button, the `SpeechRecognition` object is initialized with the selected language.
- **Recording**: The speech is captured and converted to text in real-time.
- **Display**: The recognized text is displayed on the web page, updating dynamically.
